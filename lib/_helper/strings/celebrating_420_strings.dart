      '''Before we get ahead of ourselves and light up in celebration, what exactly is 420? You already know the term “420” has become synonymous with cannabis culture, but the origins of the ubiquitous number are murky and often a topic of debate. Let’s dispel some of the myths.

One enduring theory is that “420” originated as the official police code for “smoking cannabis in progress.” Often, this theory goes hand-in-hand with a conspicuously unnamed police department. However, this theory has been investigated and debunked by many fact-checkers.

Another interesting but false theory is that there are 420 different chemical compounds in cannabis. This one is also easily disproved. Although researchers have identified hundreds of compounds in the plant, the number is now well over 550.

In fact, there are even more myths and legends surrounding this cannabis community institution, and none hold any weight. So, where did the term come from?''';
  static const String title1Article1Title = 'The Real Story of 420';
  static const String title1Article1Desc =
      '''According to Time Magazine’s Olivia B. Waxman, the most credible theory is that “420” dates to 1971, when a group of high school students in San Rafael, California, used it as a secret code word for smoking cannabis. The group, who called themselves “The Waldos,” would meet up at 4:20 PM to smoke and hang out. They chose that time for an obvious reason: it was after school but before their parents got home from work. And thus, the story goes, the code number 420 was born among teens, as any decent slang word is.

The term “420” then caught on among their extended circle of friends, who also started using it to refer to cannabis in public discreetly. From there, it became part of the wider cannabis culture. The odd tale of The Waldos has been corroborated by multiple sources at this point, including The New York Times and the cannabis authority High Times Magazine.

The particular significance or deeper meaning of April 20th (4/20) as a day of celebration for cannabis enthusiasts is less clear, and most likely, there simply isn’t one. Some will tell you it originated from a Grateful Dead concert in San Francisco in 1971, where someone handed out leaflets inviting people to “420” on April 20th. While that seems like it could be true, all signs point to the fact that the Waldos’ use of 420 to refer to cannabis came first, the phenomenon spread, and the association with April 20th naturally followed.

This doesn’t make the holiday meaningless, however. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. This means we can give 420 whatever deeper, personal meaning we choose, whether it’s through how we each choose to celebrate or the memories we make with our buds. 420 has unquestionably become a cultural phenomenon and a numerical celebration of all things cannabis. For that reason, April 20th is a day when cannabis enthusiasts come together to socialize, relax, and celebrate the many benefits of the plant.

Pack a basket of your favorite snacks and beverages, and don’t forget to bring some pre-rolls, a carefully packed glass piece, or a convenient vape pen. Or, include some edibles in your picnic goodies; just make sure they remain clearly labeled in their original packaging until you’re ready to take your dose so that there are no mix-ups, and be sure to inform everyone ahead of time about their cannabis content.

Find a beautiful spot in nature where you can enjoy fresh air, sunshine, and the calming effects of cannabis and where you won’t be disturbing non-users or creating trouble by indulging in cannabis. Whether you’re hiking all afternoon through the remote wilderness to reach your picnic spot or just plopping down on a roadside park bench to watch the sunset, make sure that the area you choose is legal and safe for consumption.''';

      '''4/20 has also become known as a time to celebrate the major gains that have been made in the push for cannabis legalization and decriminalization. Currently, the day serves as a great reminder to keep working until Americans from coast to coast have access to safe, legal, high-quality cannabis.

In recent years, 420 as a holiday has taken on a more mainstream tone as cannabis legalization continues to build momentum in the United States and around the globe. Over half of the states have legalized cannabis in some form, especially when you count medicinal marijuana programs. In 2018, Canada became the second country in the world to legalize cannabis for recreational use, following Uruguay’s lead in 2013.

For many of us in Arizona and other recreational-friendly states, cannabis has become a healthy and positive part of our day-to-day lives. However, it’s important to reflect on the fact that it is still controversial and stigmatized in many parts of the world, including many parts of our own country. There are still many challenges facing the cannabis industry and cannabis users, including smart regulation, fair taxation, and continued social stigma.

Legal, responsible cannabis users still face discrimination and prejudice in certain spaces. As such, there is still a need for cannabis education and awareness. 4/20 is a fantastic opportunity to spread the word.''';
