      '''Tinctures have been used for hundreds if not thousands of years as a means of preserving the medicinal properties of herbs, plants, fungi, and other natural matter that contains medicinal compounds. Since we know the medicinal properties of cannabis were also discovered centuries ago, it should be no surprise that cannabis tinctures have been around for a long time.

In fact, cannabis tinctures were available at the local pharmacist until the 20th century, when various factors (notably the push for cannabis prohibition in mainstream American politics) led to their decline. However, with the recent legalization movement, tinctures are making a major comeback and are now accessible to more people than ever.

Before you jump in, however, it’s important to understand that there are several different types of cannabis tinctures available. The one that’s right for you will depend on your individual preferences and goals. We’re here to help you understand tinctures so you can make a confident purchase with our friendly, knowledgeable staff at Kind Meds.''';

      '''We’ve already given a bare-bones definition of a tincture and explained that cannabis tinctures are a unique subcategory of cannabis extracts, but let’s dig into what all of that actually means for you as a cannabis consumer or curious shopper.

To reiterate, cannabis tinctures are liquid preparations that contain cannabinoids, such as CBD, THC, or a blend of both. They are typically created by infusing a solvent like alcohol, glycerin, or plant-based oil with cannabis flower.

In the modern retail cannabis market, a tincture product will typically be sold in a small, sealed glass bottle that comes with a dropper attachment in the cap for easy measurement and dosing. All tinctures should be tested and labeled in accordance with the law, like any other cannabis product.''';

  static const String title2Article1Title = 'Extracting Cannabinoids';
  static const String title2Article1Desc =
      '''The tincture-making process involves using a solvent to extract cannabinoids from the raw cannabis plant. This can be done using a few different mediums, however.

Simple, alcohol-based tinctures are made rather easily by soaking the plant material in alcohol and then straining off the infused liquid. If you’re planning to DIY (which is typically not recommended for any type of extract production) do not make the mistake of soaking your favorite strain in your favorite liqueur. This method requires the use of extremely high-proof alcohol.

Glycerin-based tinctures are similar in concept but use glycerin rather than alcohol as the solvent.

There are also oil-based tinctures that are, in some ways, more like the classic cannabutter you might make for a batch of “special” brownies than they are to an alcohol tincture. Oil-based tinctures are typically produced using a plant-based oil with a palatable flavor, such as olive oil or coconut oil. This way, they can be dosed orally or added to food with ease.''';
  static const String title2Article2Title = 'The Potency of Cannabis Tinctures';
  static const String title2Article2Desc =
      '''Cannabis tinctures offer the same cannabinoids and terpenes as other cannabis products in concentrated form. In that way, they are like high-end oil and wax extracts on the market and are similarly potent and effective. Take care not to confuse these two completely different categories of products, however. Concentrates like shatter, budder, and hash are designed to be vaporized in a dab rig or electronic vape device or added to smokable flower, while the tinctures we’re describing are fit for oral consumption.

In fact, tinctures are preferred over other consumption methods by some cannabis enthusiasts not just due to their serious potency but also their convenience, discrete nature, and precise dosing. A quick drop or two under the tongue is all it takes to get your desired amount of THC or CBD.''';

  static const String title3Article1Title = 'Alcohol-Based Tinctures';
  static const String title3Article1Desc =
      '''Alcohol-based tinctures are a common type of cannabis tincture. They are known for their fast-acting effects and long shelf life, but they do have a strong taste that may be unpleasant to many. You also must consider the fact that they are made of alcohol, which not everyone likes to ingest. However, they do mix well with water-based foods and drinks.

You may have read that creating alcohol-based tinctures at home is actually quite simple. While this is reasonably true, it’s not recommended because, unlike a professional retail cannabis operation, you will not have access to state-of-the-art testing so that you know the exact strength and cannabinoid levels of your DIY tincture. For that reason, it’s recommended to purchase from a reputable adult-use dispensary like Kind Meds when you’re in the market for an alcohol-based product.''';

  static const String title3Article2Title = 'Oil-Based Tinctures';
  static const String title3Article2Desc =
      'Oil-based tinctures use plant- or nut-based oils as the medium, resulting in a more viscous product and much milder taste as compared to alcohol-based tinctures. Oil tinctures are a popular choice for individuals looking for an option that mixes well with buttery or creamy foods. Oil-based tinctures are sometimes known to take slightly longer to take effect but can also have a longer duration of action to make up for it.';

  static const String title3Article3Desc =
      'Glycerin-based tinctures are an intriguing third option, as they are alcohol-free, liquid rather than oily, offer a sweeter taste compared to other tinctures, and mix well with beverages. And while they come with a touch of sweetness, they’re actually sugar-free. A downside is that glycerin-based tinctures typically have a shorter shelf life when compared to alcohol-based tinctures, so they’re best for folks who are going to use their cannabis tincture regularly enough that they go through their supply before it goes bad.';

  static const String title4Article1Desc =
      '''“Edibles” refer to cannabis-infused food or drink products that can come in as many different forms as there are different foods. They are consumed orally and are metabolized in the digestive system.

Edible cannabis products have a lot of similarities to tinctures, as both involve the oral consumption of cannabis (although tinctures can also be absorbed under the tongue). In fact, tinctures are often used to create DIY edibles. Both offer a long-lasting and potent effect that is fairly discreet and accurate to dose, but the onset time can be slower with edibles than it is with tinctures.

One drawback of edibles that some fail to consider before it’s too late: for users looking for a more controlled experience, an edibles experience can sometimes last too long.''';

In fact, you can find just about any type of health and beauty product with either CBD or full-spectrum cannabis in it these days, not just topical lotions.

Full-spectrum topical cannabis products are great for targeted relief of aches and pains, but for full-body cannabis effects, you’ll need to stick to tinctures or another method. Absorbing cannabinoids through the skin is simply not going to hit your system in quite the same way.''';

    'For sublingual use, you place a few drops of the tincture under your tongue and hold it there for a minute or two. This allows for rapid absorption through the sublingual mucous membranes, which means a much faster onset of effects than orally consumed cannabis that has to be processed through your gastrointestinal system.',
