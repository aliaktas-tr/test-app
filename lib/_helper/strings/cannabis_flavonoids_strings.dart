      '''Flavonoids consist of several groups of polyphenolic compounds that appear as secondary metabolites in plants and fungi. This group of plant compounds have a structure similar to flavone (hence, the term flavonoid) and play an important role in producing various plant pigments, such as the colors yellow, purple, blue, and red. There are over 6,000 varieties of flavonoids, providing a wide range of functions. [1]

The term flavone, and the subsequent term flavonoid, stem from the Latin term flavus, which means blonde or yellow in color. This is the primary color found in nature. When it comes to cannabis specifically, flavonoids make up a generous share of the plant’s known compounds and exist in dozens of varieties within the cannabis plant. Cannabis shares flavonoids with other flowers, fruits, and vegetables, but there are also some flavonoids that are unique to the cannabis plant.''';

  static const String title2 = 'How Do Flavonoids Work?';
  static const String title2Desc =
      '''Within nature, flavonoids work in several diverse ways. They can alter the appearance of a plant or flower, adding a pop of color that can attract pollinators and also influence the way we see our fruits and vegetables. Flavonoids also provide distinctive qualities that help distinguish between different strains of plants, including cannabis. They can affect the pigmentation of the cannabis plant, in the way that they can affect flowers or fruits like blueberries. Flavonoids play a key role in the different perceived shades of reds, purples, or blues in plants.

While flavonoids are primarily known as plant pigments, they do much more than just provide color. They also have protective properties, and a variety of other benefits for the plant. For example, flavonoids also help protect against certain elements, such as harmful UV rays, pests, and diseases. Flavonoids are known to help with seed development and growth.

Of course, flavonoids don’t just serve the plant itself, but also the organisms that consume it—positive effects of cannabis flavonoids are passed on to those who choose to smoke, vape, or otherwise consume it. One of the biggest benefits of flavonoids is associated with how they work as antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents. [2]''';

      'Cardiovascular disease is considered one of the top killers around the world, but certainly in the United States. Flavonoids have been linked to improving cardiovascular health, including positive benefits when it comes to treating heart disease and high blood pressure.

They can also aid in vasodilation and regulate the cell death process within the lining of blood vessels.';

      'Diabetes continues to affect the health of more and more Americans annually. Depending on type, diabetes involves either an increased level of blood glucose or an increase in insulin resistance.

For example, you can find quercetin in apples, berries, citrus fruits, kale, red onions, cocoa, and more.

Quercetin appears to work as a strong antioxidant that helps to fight free radicals within the body. It also works as an anti-inflammatory, antifungal, and antiviral agent. Future research is aimed at linking quercetin to improved physical and mental performances.''';

  static const String title5 = 'Cannabis Flavonoids Are Not Cannabinoids';
  static const String title5Desc =
      '''It is important to understand that flavonoids are not cannabinoids. These are two different types of compounds, both found in the cannabis plant. Cannabinoids work within the ECS and are primarily found in nature—endocannabinoids are produced by the human body itself. Meanwhile, flavonoids are produced by plants. While these two compounds are different, they do work together in a synergetic nature, often referred to as the entourage effect.

The entourage effect describes the way the various cannabis compounds work together to create an overall more beneficial effect once ingested. Cannabinoids work within our bodies by interacting with cannabinoid receptors throughout the endocannabinoid system, a system that includes the brain and central nervous system, digestive system, and more. These interactions serve to create the effect of cannabis on the body but can be further altered and influenced by both terpenes and flavonoids. The combined effects of all cannabis compounds are what makes us experience each cannabis strain differently.''';

  static const String title6Desc =
      '''The flavor and aroma of different cannabis plants are often attributed to terpenes. While this is true, researchers are now discovering the important role that flavonoids play as well. Getting the most out of cannabis flavonoids largely depends on the interaction achieved between the flavonoids and the terpenes.

Flavonoids do much more than affect the color and odor of the cannabis strain. As mentioned, they also play a role in altering the way you experience your cannabis upon consumption. Terpenes also work closely with cannabinoids, creating different effects depending on the combination of terpenes, cannabinoids, and flavonoids present. All compounds can provide therapeutic, physical, and mental benefits on their own.

Unless you’ve isolated cannabinoids, terpenes, or flavonoids, you’ll experience them together via the entourage effect. This is why some cannabis can leave you feeling alert and creative while others can leave you feeling relaxed and lethargic.''';

  static const String title7Desc =
      '''No two cannabis plants are the same. In today’s market, you’ll encounter hybrid plants that are designed to have the best compounds of different strains to provide the most beneficial effects possible. Strains can be created with different goals in mind, such as providing body relaxation, pain relief, creative inspiration, and more. The achieved effect is accomplished by cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids all working together. Thus, different concentrations of the various compounds can produce significantly different results.

There is still research that needs to be done to understand the different effects achieved by different proportions of flavonoids to terpenes. Cannabis affects everyone differently due to a wide variety of factors such as age, activity levels, weight, gender, and more. As researchers continue to discover more about the entourage effect, we will continue to learn more about the detailed ways flavonoids work with terpenes.''';
