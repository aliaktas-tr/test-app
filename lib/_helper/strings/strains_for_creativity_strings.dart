      'Though it is commonly accepted that cannabis enhances creativity and the process of creating, how does this enhancement factor actually work? There are a few changes that are brought about by cannabis that affect how components of the brain operate. These may potentially boost the creative process.';

  static const String title1ArticleTitle1 = 'Frontal Lobe Enhancement';
  static const String title1ArticleDesc1 =
  '''The frontal lobe is important for several reasons, one of those being its use in the creative process. Research has revealed that creative individuals often have more activity in this area of the brain, whereas those with damage to their frontal lobe experience less creative thinking. So, how does cannabis factor into this? Cannabis use appears to enhance the blood flow to many areas of the brain, most critically, the frontal lobe. With more blood flow to this area of the brain, this could allow increased potential for creative thinking.

Research also shows that cannabis enhances divergent thinking, making more creative thoughts available to the individual. When you utilize divergent thinking, you’re branching out in a non-linear thinking path, allowing a variety of ideas to come to you from a seemingly small starting point. Cannabis allows that thinking to broaden and assist the creative process.''';

  static const String title1ArticleTitle2 = 'Dopamine Increases';
  static const String title1ArticleDesc2 =
      'Another effect cannabis has on the brain is on dopamine levels, which increase directly after cannabis consumption. Other, well-known emotional impacts of cannabis, such as relaxation and reduction of anxiety, can prompt a better flow of ideas. All these emotional changes together can allow for a less critical eye on your own thoughts and ideas, while allowing freer creation of new or interesting ideas. In this way, the ability of cannabis to drive down anxiety while also boosting divergent thinking and positive emotions may lead to the creation of ideas, art, music, and writing.';

  static const String title1ArticleTitle3 = 'Affinity For Creativity';
  static const String title1ArticleDesc3 =
      'Not all research points to brain changes as the primary reasons for cannabis spurring creative thinking, however. Other studies suggest that the personality type most likely to use cannabis is one that is open to new experiences, and will therefore be open to the creative process. If you’re using cannabis, you may already be looking for something to open up your creative process. Being open to that experience means you’re open to the ideas that come with using cannabis.';

  static const String title2 = 'What Terpene Makes You Creative?';
  static const String title2Desc =
      'Terpenes are organic chemical compounds produced by cannabis and other plants that control a variety of characteristics, including taste, smell, and even the effects of the cannabis strain. Since terpenes have such a profound effect on each strain, it’s no surprise that different terpenes can affect different levels of creative thinking.';
  static const String title2Article1 =
      'Pinene is well-known to be a primary terpene affecting innovation and inspiration, as it helps with access to long-term memory and increases attention span.';

  static const String title2ArticleDesc =
      'Finding the right terpenes for your creative process can help you enhance your creative inspiration. It’s also helpful to understand more about how different cannabis strains are grown and created, to help you select a variety with sufficient levels of the above terpenes.';

  static const String title3 = 'Is Indica or Sativa Better For Art?';
  static const String title3Desc =
  '''Today’s cannabis strains are nearly always a blend of indica and sativa strains, but choosing a strain that heavily features one of these two general strains can help you access the benefits they’re best known for. Most consider sativa-dominant strains best for creativity. If you’re trying to make art, you don’t want to feel tired and sedated, and these are the general effects of more indica-dominant strains. Sativa, on the other hand, is often more energizing and uplifting. It’s among strains that boost productivity.

However, this general assumption is not the end-all-be-all of your cannabis strain selection. Even within the two categories, there are strains that can have the opposite effect than one would expect from an indica-dominant or sativa-dominant strain. While those broad understandings are important to begin with, what really counts is the inclusion of the terpenes we’ve discussed, as well as the strain’s THC to CBD ratio. When looking for more creative strains, it’s important to find one with plenty of THC and relatively low doses of CBD.''';
