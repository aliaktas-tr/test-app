This occurs in an entirely different way than smoking or vaping, which relies on allowing the cannabinoids to pass into the bloodstream via the lungs.';

    'Because metabolizing THC results in psychoactive byproducts that must then interact with the ECS, the psychoactive “high” from edibles lasts longer than that from smoking (6-12 hours versus 2-3 hours).',
    'Because edibles must be digested first, their effects can take an hour or more to kick in fully, whereas the effects of smoking THC are almost instantaneous.',
    'While the actual effects of smoked versus ingested cannabis are comparable, the experience with edibles is considered “stronger” by most users. This is likely due to the additional psychoactive byproducts produced as the body breaks down THC.'

      '''Before we can dive into a batch of brownies, however, we need to make the key ingredient that can be used to create just about any type of edible you can imagine. From cannabis hot wings to cannabis birthday cake, most homemade edible recipes start with cannabutter, or cannabis-infused butter.

Note: For those who need a dairy-free cannabutter alternative for baking and other applications, coconut oil is a preferred substitute. Or, if you’re specifically interested in making cannabis-infused dressings and sauces, you might consider using olive oil.

Preparing a batch of your own cannabutter or cannabis-infused coconut oil will unlock the world of cannabis edibles by giving you access to all sorts of amazing recipes using cannabutter. Just how many recipes, you ask? You’ll be happy to learn that basically any recipe using butter or cooking oil can be infused with THC simply by substituting cannabutter.

What follows are the general steps for making cannabutter. You can also bookmark our detailed step-by-step guide to understand how to determine the strength of your cannabutter for future reference. Also, visit our THC calculator to really dig into the math.''';
