In this way, cannabis-infused beer is a good choice for a healthy alternative to more popular beer brands. [1] Perhaps even better—you can have a ton of fun with the term “cannabeer.”

Here are some great summer beers that work well to infuse with cannabis. Keep in mind: hops have some of the same terpenes as cannabis (namely myrcene, humulene, and caryophyllene), so hoppier, bolder beers pair especially well with cannabis.''';

Place the flower in the jar and slowly add your liquor. Close the jar and shake vigorously for a few minutes. You’ll need to leave your jar in a cool, dark place for at least seven days and shake at least once per day.

After only fifteen minutes, your tea will reach a high cannabinoid concentration but will then become more muted once chilled in the fridge.

These leaves can be used alongside or as a replacement for other baby salad leaves, so there are many recipe options available. You could even chop the leaves up and add them to a fruit salad, along with other herbs, for something light and summery. [4] Consider preparing your favorite summer salad and having leaves on the side so your guests can add as little or as much as they’re comfortable with.

Guests might instead prefer to use cannabis oil on their salad or a cannabis-infused dressing. Providing these options on the side allows for a customized and self-controlled experience your guests will enjoy. Oil can be used as an addition to any dressing that makes use of olive oil, including Greek, Italian and even raspberry vinaigrettes. As an added bonus, cannabis oil adds healthy fatty acids like omega-6 and omega-3 to your diet. [5]''';

If the party is primarily outdoors, try some festive outdoor string lights around the perimeter, and make sure your garden is looking good as well. A nice-looking yard is the place to be for a summer party, so encourage people to go outside by having music, shade, and outdoor activities like sports or swimming.
